# Verification Scripts

This directory contains automated verification scripts created during the bug fix process for critical issues in the SmartSub application.

## üìã **Purpose**

These scripts verify the implementation of fixes for:

1. **App Crash on PAUSE** - Critical SIGABRT crash when pause button clicked during whisper processing
2. **FFprobe Path Resolution** - Audio duration detection failure in packaged applications
3. **GPU Detection Logging** - Generic GPU messages replaced with specific ones
4. **FFmpeg Redundancy** - Elimination of duplicate FFmpeg packages (~45MB savings)
5. **End-to-End Workflow** - Integration testing across all components

## üìÅ **Scripts Overview**

### **Individual Component Verification**

- `verify-ffprobe-config.js` - FFprobe cross-platform path resolution
- `verify-task-cancellation.js` - Task cancellation/pause functionality
- `verify-gpu-logging.js` - GPU detection logging clarity
- `verify-redundancy-elimination.js` - FFmpeg package consolidation
- `verify-e2e-workflow.js` - End-to-end workflow integration

### **Critical Issue Verification**

- `verify-critical-fixes.js` - Overall verification of all major fixes
- `verify-callback-safety.js` - Precise verification of native callback safety (crash fix)

## üöÄ **Usage**

Run individual verification scripts:

```bash
# From project root
node scripts/verification/verify-critical-fixes.js
node scripts/verification/verify-callback-safety.js
# ... etc
```

Or run all verifications:

```bash
# Run all verification scripts
for script in scripts/verification/verify-*.js; do
  echo "Running $script..."
  node "$script"
  echo "---"
done
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Results**

All scripts should output:

- ‚úÖ **PASSED** indicators for successful verifications
- üìã **Detailed analysis** of code implementations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings** for manual testing requirements
- üéØ **Summary** of verification status

## üìù **Verification Methodology**

These scripts perform **static code analysis** by:

1. Reading source files and configurations
2. Checking for specific implementation patterns
3. Validating that dangerous patterns are eliminated
4. Confirming safety mechanisms are in place
5. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility

## üé≠ **Limitations**

These are **static verification scripts** - they validate code structure but cannot test runtime behavior. Manual testing is still required for:

- Actual app crash prevention
- Real pause/cancel functionality
- Packaged application behavior
- Cross-platform compatibility

## üìö **Context**

Created during the resolution of critical issues identified in:

- `.claude/bugs/pause-cancel-error.log`
- `.claude/bugs/app-crashed.log`

These scripts helped verify that the implemented fixes correctly addressed the root causes of the critical issues without introducing regressions.

## üßπ **Maintenance**

These verification scripts can be:

- **Kept** for future regression testing
- **Adapted** for continuous integration
- **Removed** if no longer needed
- **Updated** when code changes require verification updates

They serve as both verification tools and documentation of the fixes implemented.
